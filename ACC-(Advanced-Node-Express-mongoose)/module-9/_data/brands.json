    "description": "pchanda made a foray with soyabean oil, the edible oil market was commodity-driven and the consumer awareness was extremely low. The market was dominated by ‘loose selling’- oil in readily packaged format was an unknown concept. From entering a category at a time when it was completely commodity driven to building a brand that today resonates with ‘happy family moments’ – a consumer need-state, transcending category level relations is remarkable. Every marketing activity in all spheres of Rupchanda Soyabean Oil is crafted and executed with the focused intent of improving the quality of life of its consumers.",
