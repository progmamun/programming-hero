# Into the Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

- OOP is a programming paradigm.
- OOP was developed to maintain a structured code base.
- We use object as model to describe real-world data or abstract feature.
- Object may contain Data(property) and Functionality (methods).
- In OOP, object are self-contained blocks of code.
- Objects can interact with one another.
- Interactions happen through a public interface: methods that the code outside of the object can access.

## Fundamental Pillars of OOP

1. Abstraction

- Hiding the details that don't matter.

2. Encapsulation

- Keeping some properties and methods private inside the class so they are not accessible from outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as public interface.

3. Inheritance

- Making all properties and methods of certain class available to child class. This allows us to reuse similar logic.

4. Polymorphism

- A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class.
