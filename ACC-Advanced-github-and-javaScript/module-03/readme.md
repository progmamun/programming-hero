# Into the Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

- OOP is a programming paradigm.
- OOP was developed to maintain a structured code base.
- We use object as model to describe real-world data or abstract feature.
- Object may contain Data(property) and Functionality (methods).
- In OOP, object are self-contained blocks of code.
- Objects can interact with one another.
- Interactions happen through a public interface: methods that the code outside of the object can access.
